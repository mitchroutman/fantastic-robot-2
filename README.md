# MITCHELL ROUTMAN - PORTFOLIO

# DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project was to create an initial draft of a functional website using HTML and CSS to display and share projects. This resolves the issue that many new developers face - the inability to showcase work for future employment.

The revised version of this portfolio utilizes Boostrap components (nav, cards) to share a more streamlined, modern layout. The cards have been replaced with boostrap components for a more professional layout for latest projects.
